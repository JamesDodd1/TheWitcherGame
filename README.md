## 6. Inspiration
This game is partially inpired by one my university module's courseworks, which contained multiple different types of projects, and had to complete only one of our choosing.  Because I didn't select this for my coursework, I wanted to attempt it as a challenge, and to see what I could do now and to extend the feature beyond the specifications using my knowledge I've since gained.
